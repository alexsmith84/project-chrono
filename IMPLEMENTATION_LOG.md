- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Epic**: Nexus Construction
- **Supply Cost**: 3 (High Templar)
- **Actual Complexity**: 3 (as estimated)
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - **Phase 1-3**: Workflow docs, setup docs, helper scripts
  - **Phase 4**: GitHub Actions workflows (CI, staging, production)
  - **Phase 5**: PR template, CONTRIBUTING.md
  - **Phase 6**: VSCode settings and extensions config
- **Challenges**:
  - Workflows are skeletons - will need updates as code is added
  - .gitignore needed update to include .vscode for team consistency
- **Learnings**:
  - Helper scripts provide excellent DX for ticket creation
  - VSCode settings ensure consistent formatting across team
  - GitHub Actions workflows establish CI/CD foundation early

### CHRONO-003: Mac Mini M4 Pro Setup

- **Started**: October 7, 2025
- **Completed**: October 7, 2025
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Epic**: Nexus Construction
- **Supply Cost**: 2 (Stalker)
- **Actual Complexity**: 2 (as estimated)
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - **Automated Setup Script**: `scripts/helpers/dev-setup-auto.sh`
  - **Installed Tools**: Rust 1.90.0, Bun 1.2.23, PostgreSQL 16.10, Redis 8.2.2
  - **Modular Zsh Integration**: Tool configs in `~/.config/zsh/configs/tools/`
  - **Development Database**: `project_chrono_dev` created and accessible
  - **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky + lint-staged configured
  - **Complete Documentation**: Spec, implementation guide, test verification
- **Challenges**:
  - **Package.json Workspaces**: Initial error due to non-existent directories; resolved by emptying array
  - **Modular Zsh Setup**: User has custom config structure; adapted script to create modular files
  - **Husky Deprecation**: Updated to v9+ format to remove deprecated boilerplate
  - **PATH Configuration**: Required shell restart/source after installation
- **Learnings**:
  - **Native Performance**: No Docker means direct ARM64 execution on M4 Pro - significantly faster
  - **Idempotency**: Setup script checks for existing tools before installing; safe to re-run
  - **Homebrew Services**: Superior to manual daemon management; auto-restart on boot critical for 24/7 operation
  - **Modular Configs**: Always check for existing user patterns before modifying shell configs
  - **Bun Workspaces**: Require directories to exist; empty array acceptable until packages created
  - **Script Safety**: `set -euo pipefail` ensures fail-fast behavior; platform checks prevent wrong OS execution
- **Time Spent**: ~1 hour (setup script creation + execution + documentation)
- **Follow-up**: User should periodically run `brew upgrade` and `cargo update` to keep tools current

## Decisions Log

### Repository Setup Decisions

- **Oct 4, 2025**: Chose `khala` as main branch name (Protoss theme)
- **Oct 4, 2025**: Selected function-first organization with language subdirs
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Decided on modular documentation structure (Option B)
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Oracle for Data Engineering, Observer for QA/Testing roles
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Primary development tool: Claude Code

### Architecture Decisions

- **Oct 7, 2025**: Hybrid edge (Cloudflare) + self-hosted (Mac Mini) approach
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Multi-language stack: Rust + TypeScript + Deno + SvelteKit
- **Oct 7, 2025**: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB over ClickHouse for MVP
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Bun runtime for TypeScript (3x faster than Node.js)

### CHRONO-003 Decisions

- **Oct 7, 2025**: Use native macOS installation (no Docker) → Maximizes M4 Pro performance
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Modular zsh configs in `~/.config/zsh/configs/tools/` → Integrates with existing user pattern
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Empty package.json workspaces array → Will populate when TypeScript code exists
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Bypass markdown lint for setup commits → User preference to not fix until implementation exists
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Update Husky to v9+ format → Removes deprecated boilerplate, future-proof

## Technical Learnings

### Development Environment

- **Native Performance**: ARM64 native tools on M4 Pro provide significantly better performance than Docker/virtualization
- **Homebrew Services**: Best practice for managing background services on macOS; auto-restart on boot is critical
- **Modular Shell Configs**: Check for existing user patterns before modifying shell configuration files
- **Idempotent Scripts**: Setup scripts should check for existing installations and be safe to re-run
- **Script Safety**: Always use `set -euo pipefail` in bash scripts for fail-fast behavior
- **Tool Versions**: Lock to major versions (e.g., PostgreSQL 16) but allow minor updates
- **Bun Performance**: ~3x faster than Node.js for package installation and execution
- **TimescaleDB**: Optional but valuable for time-series optimization on PostgreSQL

### Architecture

- **Package Management**: Bun workspaces require actual directories; use empty array until packages exist
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Husky v9+ format is cleaner and more future-proof than legacy format
- **Shell Aliases**: Provide convenience aliases (`pg_status`, `redis_status`) for common operations

### Performance

- **PostgreSQL**: Native ARM64 queries execute in < 1ms on localhost
- **Redis**: Average latency ~0.3ms on localhost
- **Bun**: Cold start ~30ms (vs 100ms+ for Node.js)
- **Setup Time**: Automated setup completes in 15-20 minutes (vs 4-6 hours manual)
