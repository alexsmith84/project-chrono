# Implementation Guides

Step-by-step implementation guides for Project Chrono features.

## Purpose

While specs define **WHAT** to build, implementation guides define **HOW** to build it:

- Prerequisites and setup steps
- Detailed implementation checklist
- Code examples and patterns
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Debugging guidance
- Verification steps

## Using Implementation Guides

1. Read the corresponding spec first (`docs/specs/CHRONO-XXX-*.md`)
2. Follow the implementation guide step-by-step
3. Check off items as you complete them
4. Refer to debugging section if stuck
5. Verify completion per the guide's checklist

## Template

Use `IMPL-TEMPLATE.md` as the starting point for all implementation guides.
