## Scaling Scenarios

### Growth Phase (50M+ FLR Delegated)

**Additional Monthly Costs:**

| Item | Cost | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| Second Mac Mini | $15 | Redundancy/failover |
| Cloud backup (S3) | $10 | Offsite backups |
| Premium monitoring | $20 | Enhanced observability |
| **Additional** | **$45** | |
| **New Total** | **$113/month** | |

### Scale Phase (100M+ FLR Delegated)

**Additional Monthly Costs:**

| Item | Cost | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| Third Mac Mini | $15 | Load distribution |
| Premium API keys | $50 | Higher rate limits |
| Dedicated server space | $30 | Data center rack space |
| Business insurance | $25 | Equipment protection |
| **Additional** | **$120** | |
| **New Total** | **$233/month** | |

## Cost vs Cloud Comparison

### Self-Hosted (Current Approach)

**Total Cost** (3 years):

- Hardware: $2,199 (one-time)
- Operating: $816/year × 3 = $2,448
- **Total: $4,647** ($129/month avg)

### Cloud Alternative (AWS/GCP)

**Monthly Costs**:

- EC2 instances (3×): $200
- RDS PostgreSQL: $150
- ElastiCache Redis: $50
- Data transfer: $100
- Monitoring: $50
- **Total: $550/month** ($19,800 over 3 years)

**Savings with Self-Hosted**: $15,153 (77% reduction)

---

## ROI Analysis

### Break-Even on Hardware

Mac Mini pays for itself when:

```
Monthly Savings = $550 (cloud) - $68 (self-hosted) = $482
Break-even time = $2,199 / $482 = 4.6 months
```

**Conclusion**: Hardware investment recovered in ~5 months

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Power Management**: Mac Mini uses 30W avg vs 100W+ for servers
2. **Cooling**: Minimal cooling needed vs data center AC costs
3. **Bandwidth**: Residential business internet vs expensive data center bandwidth
4. **Upgrades**: RAM/SSD upgradeable on Mac Mini vs cloud scaling costs
