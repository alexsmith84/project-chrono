# Test Specifications

Comprehensive test specifications for all Project Chrono features.

## Coverage

Every ticket has an associated test specification that includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions/components
- **Integration Tests**: Testing component interactions
- **Performance Tests**: Load, stress, and soak testing
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, input validation
- **Manual Verification**: For infrastructure and configuration tickets

## Test Strategy

- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on PR creation
- Performance tests run before deployment
- Security tests run weekly and before releases

## Using Test Specs

1. Write test spec alongside feature spec
2. Implement tests before or during feature development (TDD encouraged)
3. All tests must pass before merging
4. Update test spec when requirements change

## Template

Use `TEST-TEMPLATE.md` for creating new test specifications.
